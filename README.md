Console
=======

Console is an UI for Analytics PaaS. It has three main responsibilities:

 * static resources hosting (HTML, JS, etc.);
 * user authentication;
 * reverse proxy for services.

##Local Development

### Requirements
* Nodejs
* Ruby (tested on version 2.1.5)
* Compass (required to compile stylesheets) - to install type:
  ```
sudo gem install compass
```

### Running

Before running the console, you have to install Node dependencies, compile UI. After that you can start console running NPM start task

```
npm install
node ./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js
npm start
```

### Setting up dependencies
Console is only a reverse-proxy - it doesn't have application logic. To run and develop console locally, it's needed to configure the console to know where the dependencies are. There is no need to set up all dependent microservices at once. Most of the time developer works on 1-2 features and uses a few microservices only.

Although, there is one project always required - [user-management](https://github.com/trustedanalytics/user-management) which is responsible for downloading user details, organizations list, etc. A whole list of dependencies is stored in [service-mapping.json](app/server/config/service-mapping.json).

To run the service locally or in Cloud Foundry, the VCAP_SERVICES environment variables with proper values inside needs to be defined:
```
export VCAP_SERVICES='{
  "user-provided": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "apiEndpoint": "<Cloud Foundry API endpoint>",
     "authorizationUri": "<OAuth authorization endpoint>",
     "checkTokenUri": "<UAA endpoint for authorization token validation>",
     "clientId": "<client ID used for OAuth authorization>",
     "clientSecret": "<client secret used for OAuth authorization>",
     "logoutUri": "<URI to logout.do in UAA server>",
     "tokenKey": "<UAA endpoint for verifying token signatures>",
     "tokenUri": "<OAuth token authorization endpoint>"
    },
    "name": "sso"
   }
  ]
}'
```

#### Binding to external microservices
It's the easiest way of setting up a local environment. The idea is to spin up the console only and connect it to microservices already running in an external environment. It can be done be using ``vcap.**`` property. For example if we want to connect to user-management service
deployed on CF we need to add an value to VCAP_SERVICES environment:

```
export VCAP_SERVICES='{
  "user-provided": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     /** SSO configuration **/
    },
    "name": "sso"
   },
   {
    "credentials": {
     "host": "http://user-management.<CF instance base url>"
    },
    "name": "user-management"
   }
  ]
}'
```

All the properties used for external services binding can be found in [local-services.json](app/server/config/local-services.json) file.

#### Binding to local microservices
An alternative to binding to external services is setting up dependent microservices on a local machine. Having them running locally there is no need to configure anything if they are running on proper ports. Such mappings of port - microservice can be found in [local-services.json](app/server/config/local-services.json).
Instructions how to run particular microservices can be found in README of those projects.

### Developing web application
The backend part of the console is responsible only for authentication and reverse proxying the requests. The main content is the JavaScript code, which requires compilation from the source files (i.e. jade and scss) to browser readable formats.

#### Recompiling via Gulp
[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) is a NodeJS build system for web sites.

After downloading dependencies using NPM, it's possible to run Gulp from the console root directory, which will compile all of web sources and hot deploy them on the server.
```
./node_modules/gulp/bin/gulp.js
```

 It's also possible to install gulp globally:
```
npm install -g gulp
```

Since running whole build process takes some time, during development process it's handy to use `gulp watch` command which automatically recompiles proper part of the code after each file change.
```
$ gulp watch
[16:49:59] Using gulpfile ~/console/gulpfile.js
[16:49:59] Starting 'watch:app'...
[16:49:59] Finished 'watch:app' after 223 ms
[16:49:59] Starting 'watch:new-account'...
[16:49:59] Finished 'watch:new-account' after 12 ms
[16:49:59] Starting 'watch'...
[16:49:59] Finished 'watch' after 6.3 Î¼s
[16:50:20] Starting 'scripts:app'...
[16:50:20] Finished 'scripts:app' after 454 ms

```

## Deploying to Cloud Foundry
To deploy to Cloud Foundry we will assume a environment without internet access.
First we will have to cache our dependencies:
```
rm -r ./node_modules/* npm-shrinkwrap.json # First delete all to get rid of the devDependencies
NODE_ENV=production npm install # Install the production dependencies locally
npm shrinkwrap # lockdown the module versions
```

Now we can push the console app to our Cloud Foundry:
```
cf push
```
